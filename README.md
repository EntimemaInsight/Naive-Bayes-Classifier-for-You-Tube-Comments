# Naïve-Bayes-Classifier-for-YouTube-Comments

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the application of a Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier to analyze a dataset of YouTube comments. The objective is to build a predictive model that can classify comments as either "Ham" (non-spam) or "Spam." This analysis provides valuable insights into classifying comments and can be used for comment moderation on YouTube.
