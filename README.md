# Naïve-Bayes-Classifier-for-YouTube-Comments

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the application of a Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier to analyze a dataset of YouTube comments. The objective is to build a predictive model that can classify comments as either "Ham" (non-spam) or "Spam." This analysis provides valuable insights into classifying comments and can be used for comment moderation on YouTube.

## Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Data Preparation: Import and preprocess the YouTube comments dataset.
2. Text Classification: Utilize the Multinomial Naïve Bayes Classifier to classify comments as "Ham" or "Spam."
3. Evaluation: Assess the performance of the classifier using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Visualization: Create visualizations to better understand the distribution of comments and prediction probabilities.

## Methodology
The project follows a structured methodology:

### Data Import and Preprocessing
Import necessary libraries for data manipulation and machine learning.
Read multiple CSV files containing YouTube comments and remove irrelevant columns.
